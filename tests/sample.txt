This is a sample text file for testing our word counter.
It contains multiple lines with different types of content.

Some lines have    extra    spaces.
Others have punctuation marks: commas, periods, and exclamation points!

Numbers like 123 and 456 should be counted as words.
Special characters like @#$% might appear too.

This file helps us verify that our word counter works correctly.
